# Backend
Backend for beginners.

Hi! This is an example backend, and I will guide you through how it works. So basically, when you head to "server.js", you will see that I used express to make it. So, as you can see in line 4, I added a route. Basically, there are different requests someone can make to the backend, for example: POST, GET, DELETE. On line 4, you can see that I've added a get request, so when you try it, it will say "Hi! You are on a backend right now.". Lastly, dont forget the port.
